\textbf{Software Engineer}, \href{https://ripple.com/}{Ripple} \hfill \textbf{Summer 2017} \\
Ripple provides one frictionless experience to send money globally using the power of blockchain.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Designed and built out a framework to simulate consensus and validation on XRP Ledger.
	\item Designed metrics to report QoS and  to have visibility into network fragility
	\item Researched benefits and constraints of potential modifications to the consensus protocol.
	\item Became proficient in modern C++ (11/14) generics and meta-template programming
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Software Engineer}, \href{https://www.intel.com}{Intel} \hfill \textbf{Summer 2015}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Modified OpenMPI to route network I/O through DPDK framework.
	\item Debugged OpenMPI and DPDK-based TCP/IP user-space network stacks to diagnose errors.
	\item Implemented deficiencies in DPDK-based TCP/IP network stacks to make them compatible with OpenMPI.
	\item Diagnosed and resolved linkage errors resulting from the interaction of several layers of shared/static libraries.
