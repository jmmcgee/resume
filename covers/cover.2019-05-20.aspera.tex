\opening{To whom it may concern:}

%PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type 
%of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you 
%learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, 
%newspaper, employment service, personal contact). 

I am writing to apply for a position of  Application Developer - Java (Job Number: 00693423) at Accenture.

%PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, 
%the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you 
%can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain 
%how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for 
%the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out 
%specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat 
%the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer 
%the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes 
%your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of 
%this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details 
%which bring your experiences to life.

In 2015, I co-founded Archer which sought to provide quality user engagement data and analytics to advertisers, while establishing relationships with commercial venues to rent out space for our kiosks. My work on Archer spanned much of my undergraduate and all of my graduate career, and I learned a great deal through the experience, adapting to whatever was needed of me.

I am confident that the experience I've gained---throughout my undergraduate and graduate education in Computer Science, internships at Intel and Ripple, as well as my own enterprise---commends me. In particular, I believe my exposure to High Speed Networking Research at UC Davis and to distributed systems and network programming at Intel and Ripple make me a good fit for this role.

My resume, synopsizing my experience is enclosed. Please contact me for an interview at \email or \phone as soon as is convenient. Correspondence over email is preferred.

 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your 
%flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in 
%the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For 
%example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is 
%located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. 
%Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an 
%interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking 
%time to consider your credentials. 

Thank you for your consideration.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
